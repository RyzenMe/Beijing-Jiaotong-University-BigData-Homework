    "A neural network is a supervised classification algorithm. With your help, it kind of teaches itself how to make better classifications.\n",

    "For a basic neural net, you have three primary components: an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer, each consisting of nodes. The nodes of the input layer are basically your input variables; the nodes of the hidden layer are neurons that contain some function that operates on your input data; and there is one output node, which uses a function on the values given by the hidden layer, putting out one final calculation. If this isn't making much sense yet, don't worry. It will start coming together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each node is connected to every other node in the layers in front of it, so in other words, your input nodes aren't connected to each other, but they will be connected to every node in the hidden layer, and every node in the hidden layer will be connected to the output node.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The gray lines connecting input nodes to neurons (nodes in the hidden layer) are all weighted. These weights are some value between 0 and 1, and will be multiplied with whatever the input value is. Any node in the hidden layer — let's say $Node_A$ — will essentially have two functions; a combination function and an activation function. The combination function will likely take the summation of all of the input nodes times their respective weights. Where W is weight and X is input:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summation function: **\n",

    "$Net_A = \\sum W_{iA}X_{iA} = W_{0A}(1) + W_{1A}X_{1A} + W_{2A}X_{2A} + W_{3A}X_{3A}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is basically saying that for the first node in the hidden layer (which we've called $Node_A$), every connection to it will be summed up. So the first input and its weight is denoted $W_{1A}X_{1A}$. The second input that connects to $Node_A$ and its weight is denoted $W_{2A}X_{2A}$, and so forth. The first term $W_{0A}$ will always be constant ```1```, where this term is a constant factor, much like the intercept in regression models.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we make up some inputs and weights, the equation will look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ Net_A = (1)(0.5) + (0.4)(0.6) + (0.2)(0.8) + (0.7)(0.6) = 1.32$\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting ```1.32``` would then be input into the activation function (likely sigmoid).\n",

    "**Sigmoid function: **\n",
    "\n",
    "$y = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$y = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-1.32}} = 0.7892$\n",
    "\n",
    "This value is then given to the output node, $Node_Z$. $Node_Z$ then combines these outputs from Nodes A, B, etc. into a weighted sum (using the weights associated with the connections of these nodes). Now, $X_i$ is treated as the outputs from each node in the hidden layer, and the formula from above is used again.\n",
    "\n",
    "$Net_Z = \\sum W_{iZ} = W_{0Z} + W_{AZ}X_{AZ} + W_{BZ}X_{BZ}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The sigmoid is used again on the output of $Net_Z$, producing the true output value of the neural network's first run. Then it's run again and again for however many data points have been defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weights are what make and break the accuracy of the entire neural network. When the NN is initialized, these weights will be randomized. The neural net then operates and creates its output value, and this value is matched against what it *should* be. The error is taken, and then the neural net uses some user-defined method to go back through the net to adjust the weights so that the accuracy is maximized, and the error is minimized. If the intuition is still a little cloudy, feel free to take thirty to check the resources at the bottom of the notebook."

    "\n",
    "Neural networks require numeric inputs. It would be difficult for the algorithm to multiply something like \"married\" with some weight, and then enter that result into summation and sigmoid functions and get meaningful results. Consequently, every attribute value has to be standardized, taking values between 0 and 1, even for categorical variables. With that said, there is quite a bit to the data preparation stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tidying; Encoding; Balancing\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, I'm getting a quick feel for the data. How many attributes can we work with? How many unique values are there per attribute? Is there balance between the different potential values? I can also collapse a lot of these specific values into more general ones: \"Married-civ-spouse,\" \"Married-AF-spouse,\" and \"Married-spouse-absent\" can all be collapsed into a 'y' representing a married category. The same is done for workclass. Then I print attribute information to answer some of the above questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "With two unique categories for marital-status, I know I can use the standard LabelEncoder. With 3+ unique categories for workclass and race, I could use OneHotEncoding or create dummy variables. Later I will explain why. Additionally, we can see that there are lower proportions of some races and workclasses. If I wanted a more efficient neural net, I would attempt to balance this so that it can accurately handle these sorts of rare cases. We won't concern ourselves with that here, though."

    "Above, two different types of encoding were noted: LabelEncoder and OneHotEncoder. Though they both convert categories to numeric values, they behave in different ways. Let's say I categorize workclass and then use LabelEncoder to create an integer representation of each category. The result will be a 0 for White, 1 for Black, 2 for Asian-Pac-Islander, 3 for Amer-Indian-Eskimo, and 4 for Other. Unless this was ordinal data (like 1st place winner, 2nd, 3rd, 4th), this is unacceptable for the neural network. The neural net would calculate the distance between the first value 'White' and the fourth value 'Other' and treat this distance as if it's significant. In our case, each category is equally distant from the other in *meaning*, and shouldn't have any superficial scoring like that. So there is an alternative. OneHotEncoder breaks the variable down into a matrix of 0's and 1's. If we look at our dataframe, we can match up OneHotEncoder results with the first 16 values of the race column."

The standard descent goes through every data item, while its stochastic counterpart uses a random sample. Stochastic back-propagation also attempts to guard against getting stuck in any local minima (the algorithm is searching for the global minimum, the smallest amount of error possible). In other words, looking at an error curve, as weights are adjusted the error curve will peak, dip, and bend, and there will likely be multiple dips, but the algorithm is searching for the deepest dip, and not any of the other shallow dips.\n",

Go to the last column, there are 100 neurons in the first hidden layer, 100 in the second hidden layer, and 100 in the third hidden layer. Though I've used consistent numbers throughout each hidden layer, you could just as well have variations, like (15, 10)."

Increasing the number of hidden layers beyond 2 is arbitrary and decreases the power of back propagation (the algorithm that helps neural networks shine, by going backwards and altering input weights for increased accuracy). As for speed, I'm not quite sure why that happens, but a guess would be that when you have more hidden layers, the libraries do better in utilizing more CPU cores than less. If you use other libraries like Tensorflow, you can opt to use the GPU to run the network instead.\n",

    "\n",

    ">The number of hidden neurons should be between the size of the input layer and the size of the output layer.\n",

    "We can calculate this optimal number of neurons easily—visually, even, by looking at our dataframe header and counting the input variables. From 'sex-encoded' to 'race_White', we have 17 input nodes. Neural nets always have one output node. Using the second criterion, (17) * (2 / 3) + 1 = 12. All of the listed criteria are fulfilled; 12 is less than twice the size of the input layer (34) and is between the size of the input layer and the size of the output layer (between 1 and 17).\n",

    "Shown above, using one hidden layer and 7 neurons in that layer, we get an accuracy of 0.7812. It might be tempting to hack at the neural net to try to get a higher accuracy, but you would be lying to yourself. It isn't healthy to have the neural net learn the training dataset *too* completely, because then you have a neural net that is really close to the heart of your dataset, but can't be generalized to new data. This is known as **overfitting.** That isn't to say that it is not worth putting in a great effort for squeezing out any little bit of *legitimate* accuracy that you can. For products that scale, even a tiny amount of accuracy can do a lot of good or harm."
